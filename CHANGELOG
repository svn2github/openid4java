* discovery HTTP requests are transparently cached for increased performance
* a minimal set of library dependencies are packaged with the official release
* alternative packages are released with optional / extra functionality

* local XRI resolver updated to use the latest openXRI 1.2.0 library
* JDBC implementations for nonces and associations stores
